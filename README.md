## Notes from Vitaliy

This project doesn't use any external dependencies besides tailwind.css, which I used to make prototyping easier. It has some unit tests, linting and prettier for code formatting. I simplified the interface for DTO we are getting to show only several fields, I believe that should do for the assignment sake. As per requirements, the only thing that is a bit off here is commit history. I happened to have a small Angular project with quite similar structure already, so I recycled some parts of it to save time. So, it was not exactly a clean slate. Nonetheless, I appreciate any feedback.
